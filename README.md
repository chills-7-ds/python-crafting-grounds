# 🐍 Python Crafting Grounds

## 🧭 Overview  
This is the space for learning and mastering Python.  
Here, I’ll build small-to--medium--to-large sized projects, explore and refine my problem-solving craft.

## 🎯 Goal  
- Sharpen core Python skills and stretch them across domains  
- Keep code clean, modular and maybe a lil' poetic
