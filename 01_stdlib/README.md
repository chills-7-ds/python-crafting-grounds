# ðŸ”¹ 01\_stdlib/ â€” *Pythonâ€™s Hidden Arsenal*

Welcome to the **01\_stdlib/** module â€” focused projects built solely with Pythonâ€™s **Standard Library** tools.

No third-party libraries. Just native Python, elegantly pushed to its limits.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Projects Included

In this module, youâ€™ll find 12 standalone project folders, each focusing on a single tool (e.g., only_datetime, only_os, etc.), alongside 2 additional projects that combine multiple tools for more complex problem-solving. For detailed descriptions, please refer to the README within each folder under 01_stdlib.

---

## ðŸ§° How to Use This Folder

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open terminal in the `01_stdlib/` directory.
3. Run any project using:

   ```bash
   python3 project_name.py
   ```

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered

âœ… datetime â€“ Date and time manipulation, scheduling, logging

âœ… os & sys â€“ File system navigation, environment handling, command-line integration

âœ… shutil â€“ File/folder operations, backups, archival automation

âœ… re (regex) â€“ Pattern matching, text parsing, validation

âœ… random & secrets â€“ Randomization, secure token generation

âœ… hashlib â€“ Cryptographic hashing, data integrity

âœ… argparse â€“ CLI tools with structured arguments

âœ… time â€“ Timers, delays, performance measurement

âœ… collections â€“ Specialized containers: Counter, defaultdict, namedtuple

âœ… itertools & functools â€“ Efficient iteration, functional programming utilities

âœ… json & csv & pickle â€“ Data serialization, reading/writing structured files

âœ… logging â€“ Proper logging for scripts and applications

This folder is about building **practical command-line tools** using **only what Python gives you by default**.

A WORK IN PROGRESS FOR NOW
