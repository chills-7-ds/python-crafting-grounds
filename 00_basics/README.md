# ðŸ”¹ 00\_basics/ â€” *Pure Python, Pure Skill*

Welcome to the **00\_basics/** module â€” a hands-on collection of 7 mini-projects crafted to master **core Python fundamentals** using just raw logic and syntax.

No imports. No shortcuts. Just your brain + Python built-ins.

## Advice

These projects were intentionally built using only core Python concepts â€” no standard libraries, no advanced shortcuts â€” to strengthen the fundamentals first.

But real talk:
Most of these could be written in half the lines using tools like random, math, argparse, or even list comprehensions.

If you're comfortable using the standard libraries, I highly recommend revisiting these same projects later â€” your code will be shorter, cleaner, and much easier to maintain once you're ready to level up.
