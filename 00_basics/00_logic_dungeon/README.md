# üåí The Forgotten Cipher

> A tiny Text RPG made with pure Python logic. No libraries. No fluff. Just a keyboard, your curiosity, and some good ol‚Äô imagination.

# Goal  
To learn handling user input, using if-else for decision-making, and organizing code with functions. All while creating an engaging interactive story with only Python basics.

## üéÆ What's This?

A Text RPG (Role-Playing Game) is like an interactive storybook where **you are the main character**.  
You read.  
You choose.  
And every choice changes what happens next.

**‚ÄúThe Forgotten Cipher‚Äù** is your journey through whispers, statues, cracked mirrors, ancient tunnels, and cryptic orbs. There‚Äôs a cipher ‚Äî broken, lost, or maybe... *you* are it?

And your job?  
Find the missing piece. Before the story resets.
