# Hangman Hero ðŸ’€ðŸ”¤

# Overview

Hangman Hero is a simple CLI word-guessing game where players try to save their necks by correctly guessing letters in a hidden word. Itâ€™s a fun and interactive way to sharpen your logic and memory under pressureâ€”perfect for beginner coders and nostalgic gamers alike.

# Goal

To demonstrate the use of **variables**, **loops**, **conditionals**, **lists**, and **user input/output** in Python while building a small yet engaging terminal-based game. It reinforces control flow and real-time feedback logic.

# Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3
* **Libraries:** None (stdlib only)
* **Database:** None (all in-memory)

# Features

* 6 Lives system to simulate risk
* Real-time letter checking and feedback
* Tracks and displays wrong guesses
* Ends with a win/lose message based on player performance
* Clean UI feedback using string formatting

# How to Run

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hangman-hero.git  
```

2. Navigate into the folder:

```bash
cd hangman-hero  
```

3. Run the game:

```bash
python hangman_hero.py  
```

# Possible Extensions

* can add the play again feature
* Add support for random words using the `random` module
* Replace hardcoded logic with a dynamic letter position system
* Add visual ASCII hangman states
* Include hints or word categories
* Track player score over multiple rounds
* Build a GUI version with `tkinter`

# Any advice?
So many indentation, syntax errors so be careful from the very start.
