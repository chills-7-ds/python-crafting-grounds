# Toolbelt CLI 🛠️

# Overview  
Toolbelt CLI is a modular command-line app that bundles three everyday tools—calculator, unit converter, and password generator—into one simple interface. It's designed to mimic real-world multi-tool kits, giving beginners hands-on practice with core Python concepts.

# Goal  
To demonstrate how to organize multiple tools using modular Python files and basic CLI interaction. This project strengthens understanding of functions, user input, error handling, and modular architecture—without diving into the deep end.

# Tech Stack  
- Language: Python 3  
- Libraries: None (No external or standard libraries used!)  
- Database: N/A (No data persistence yet)

# Features  
- 📱 **CLI Interface** with menu-based navigation  
- 🧮 **Calculator**: Performs basic arithmetic  
- 📏 **Unit Converter**: Converts KM ↔ Miles  
- 🔐 **Password Generator**: Offers preset secure-ish passwords

# How to Run  
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/toolbelt_cli.git

# Navigate into the folder
cd toolbelt_cli

# Run the app
python main.py
```

# Possible Extensions

* Add color to CLI using `colorama`
* Include more converters (temperature, currency)
* Add user-defined password generator with length & character toggles
* Save past calculations using a basic file or in-memory history

# Advice

* Since these projects are focused on covering only Python basics (without diving into advanced topics or standard libraries yet), the code might look a bit longer or more manual than necessary.

If you're comfortable using the standard libraries (like random, math, or argparse), I highly recommend revisiting this same project later — your code will be shorter, cleaner, and a lot easier to understand once you're ready to level up.
