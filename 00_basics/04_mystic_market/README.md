**Mystic Market 🧙‍♀️💸**

# Overview

A text-based magical shop simulation where players buy, sell, and manage potions using gold. It mimics RPG-style trading logic and inventory handling without external libraries—perfect for mastering the Python essentials.

# Goal

To demonstrate clean modular programming using core Python concepts—variables, conditionals, loops, all function types, error handling, and inter-file module structure—without using the standard library beyond built-ins.

# Tech Stack

* **Language**: Python 3
* **Libraries**: None (only built-ins)
* **Database**: None (uses in-memory dictionaries)

# Features

* 🧺 View player inventory
* 🧪 Buy potions with gold
* 💰 Sell potions for reduced value
* 📈 Live gold tracking
* ❌ Handles invalid inputs gracefully
* 🧩 Modular code split into `main.py` and `market.py`

# How to Run

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd mystic_market/
   ```

2. **Run the game**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

# Possible Extensions

* Add leveling system & achievements
* Load/save inventory to a file (using I/O or pickle)
* Add dynamic pricing or rare item drops
* Introduce multiple vendors with specialties
* GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt (post-basics)

# 🧙‍♂️ Advice from the Mystic Merchant
* “Name it right, or no brew for you!”
* This market is case-sensitive — so type potion names exactly as shown (e.g., "Healing Potion" not healing potion).
* Mess up the casing, and you’ll be told your request doesn’t exist. It’s not personal. Just magical protocol. 🧪📜
