# Health Tracker ü©∫

# Overview  
A simple yet function-packed personal health tracking CLI app built with pure Python. This project helps log your daily physical activities, calories, water intake, and more ‚Äî while exploring different types of Python functions with real-world relevance.

# Goal  
To demonstrate the usage of all core function types in Python ‚Äî including default arguments, `*args`, `**kwargs`, lambdas, nested functions, and helper methods ‚Äî through a hands-on health logging utility.

# Tech Stack  
- Language: Python üêç  
- Libraries: None (Standard I/O only)  
- Database: Just a spicy global dictionary `health_log`  

# Features  
- `log_steps()` ‚Üí Log daily step count  
- `log_water()` ‚Üí Track water intake with default fallback  
- `log_calories()` ‚Üí Log calories consumed & burned (with optional defaults)  
- `log_activities(*args)` ‚Üí Use `*args` to log multiple activities  
- `log_activities_input()` ‚Üí Alt input method for comma-separated values  
- `log_custom(**kwargs)` ‚Üí Log custom notes like mood, sleep via `**kwargs`  
- `filter_short_activities = lambda ...` ‚Üí Use lambda to filter low-effort sessions  
- `ml_to_liters()` ‚Üí Convert milliliters to liters (helper converter)  
- `log_heart_rate()` ‚Üí Nested function example for BPM logging  
- `show_summary()` ‚Üí Output health report + intelligent suggestions  
- **BONUS:** Global `health_log` dictionary for easy state management (- A global health log is just a variable (like a dictionary) that‚Äôs defined outside any function, so that all functions can access and update it.)

# How to Run  
1. Clone the repo  
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthtrackr.git
   cd healthtrackr
````
```

2. Run it using Python

```bash
   python3 healthtrackr.py
```

# Possible Extensions

* **`weekly_summary()`**: Accept a list of 7 `health_log`-style dictionaries and compute average steps, water, calories, etc. Great for tracking weekly consistency.
* Add file logging or export to `.csv`
* Integrate with speech-to-text for faster input
* Hook into an API like Fitbit or Apple Health
* Add unit tests for individual logging functions
