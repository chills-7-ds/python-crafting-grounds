# QuizCrack

# Overview

QuizCrack is a modular Python CLI trivia game that tests usersâ€™ knowledge across different categories. It demonstrates fundamental programming concepts by combining variables, conditionals, loops, functions, error handling, and modular design. This makes it a great learning tool and a fun way to challenge your brain.

# Goal

The project aims to build a fully functional quiz game using core Python concepts without relying on external libraries. It focuses on code organization through modules and files, user input validation, and clean control flowâ€”all essentials for solid Python development.

# Tech stack

* Language: Python 3.x
* Libraries: None (only built-in functions and language features)
* Database: None (questions stored in Python dictionaries)

# Features

* Multiple trivia categories (Science, History, Pop Culture)
* User-friendly command-line interface
* Input validation for answers and menu selection
* Modular code separation (`main.py` for interface, `quizzes.py` for quiz logic)
* Real-time feedback on answers with score calculation

# How to run

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. Navigate into the folder:

   ```bash
   cd quizcrack
   ```
3. Run the quiz game:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

# Possible Extensions

* Load quiz questions dynamically from external JSON or CSV files
* Add player score persistence with a simple database or file storage
* Introduce timers for answering questions
* Implement multiple difficulty levels
* Add a GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt
* Incorporate multiplayer or online leaderboard features

# Any advice?
i only faced a few syntax errors so check your syntax whether it's dictionaries or functions.
